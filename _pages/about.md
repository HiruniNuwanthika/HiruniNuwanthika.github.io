I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/). I hold a PhD in Human-Computer Interaction from [RMIT University](https://www.rmit.edu.au/about/schools-colleges/computing-technologies).

My research focuses on participatory design, mixed-methods, and the evaluation of AI-enabled interactive systems. During my PhD, I investigated how location-based affect different stakeholders, integrating Value Sensitive Design with multimodal sensing and data-driven analysis.

I have university teaching experience across undergraduate and postgraduate computing programs. At RMIT University and the University of Melbourne, I worked as a tutor in subjects including Usability Engineering, AI and Data Science, and Database Systems.
