abstract = {Achieving sustainable urban transportation requires not only urban planning but also technological innovation, particularly for vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as cyclists, pedestrians, and e-scooter riders. While active mobility (i.e., cycling and walking) offers environmental and health benefits, VRUs face a higher risk of serious and fatal accidents than vehicles. This full-day workshop will examine how ubiquitous computing, sensing, and communication technologies can improve VRU safety, promote active mobility, and support the development of a sustainable and resilient transportation system while addressing socio-technical aspects such as legal, ethical, psychological, and normative considerations. Therefore, we will invite two keynote speakers, one from technical and one from socio-technical science, and prepare an open discussion session to foster interdisciplinary exchange. The discussion will encourage participants to explore technical innovations and socio-technical implications for enhancing VRU safety and promoting sustainable mobility.},
